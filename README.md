### E-Mail System Setup

For email configuration to work, you need to provide the needed parameters. If you wish to use Gmail (easy for local testing), you need to get the Gmail "App Password" generated by Google. Then you need to make sure EMAIL_FROM value is set to the email address you generated the password for previously, and you should set your EMAIL_PASS key as the App Password you generated.

### Configure env variables

-   Rename `.env.dev.code.example` or `.env.dev.docker.example` as `.env.dev` with proper configuration. (If you launch from docker copy .docker.example, if you launch from development environment VS Code etc..., copy .code.example)

-   Rename `.env.prod.example` as `.env.prod` with proper configuration.

### Development Mode

-   Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

-   Run dev server with hot reload

```
npm run dev
```

### Production mode

- Refer system startup commands for production launch. Check [`docker-config`](https://github.com/staucktion/docker-config) repository.
